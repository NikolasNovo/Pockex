  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">
    App: <strong>Pockex</strong><br/>
    Data Controller / App Owner: <strong>Nikolas Novo</strong><br/>
    Support: <a href="mailto:info.pockex@gmail.com">info.pockex@gmail.com</a><br/>
    Effective date: <strong>February 12, 2026</strong>
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Summary:</strong> most of your app content is stored locally on your device.
    We only process limited data needed for sign-in and subscription status (via Apple/Google and RevenueCat),
    plus optional diagnostics to keep the app stable.
  </div>

  <h2>1) Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Pockex (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the
    Pockex mobile application (the “App”) and related services.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Information we process</h2>
  <p>Depending on how you use the App, we may process the following categories of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Sign-in information (Apple / Google):</strong> if you choose to sign in, we receive a unique identifier for your account
      from Apple or Google (and, depending on your settings, possibly your name and email). For “Sign in with Apple” you may use an Apple
      private relay email address. We do not receive your Apple ID password or Google password.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Subscription and purchase status:</strong> subscription tier (Plus/Pro/Premium), billing period (monthly/yearly),
      whether the subscription is active, and related purchase events (purchase/renewal/restore). We do <em>not</em> receive or store your
      full payment card details because payments are handled by Apple App Store or Google Play.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Device and technical data:</strong> device model, OS version, language, app version, time zone, and identifiers used to
      operate the App and subscriptions (for example, an app instance identifier).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Diagnostics (optional but common):</strong> crash logs and performance data to fix bugs and improve reliability.
      <span class="muted">If you do not use crash/analytics tools, you may remove this section.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>App content:</strong> the content you create in the App (notes, lists, settings, etc.) is primarily stored locally on your device.
      If the App offers any sync/backup features in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain the App’s functionality.</li>
    <li>To authenticate you when you sign in with Apple or Google.</li>
    <li>To determine your subscription entitlement (active/inactive) and unlock premium features.</li>
    <li>To provide customer support and respond to requests.</li>
    <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues, fraud, or abuse.</li>
    <li>To improve the App (bug fixes, performance, usability).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Subscriptions and payments</h2>
  <p>
    Subscriptions are processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play). Your payment method details are handled by the store provider,
    not by us. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID / Google Play account settings.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Third-party service providers</h2>
  <p>We may share limited information with service providers that help us operate the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>RevenueCat</strong> (subscription management): used to validate purchases and determine your subscription entitlement.
      RevenueCat may process device/app identifiers and purchase status information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>: for sign-in and/or billing and subscription management.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Diagnostics providers</strong> (if enabled): crash reporting/performance monitoring tools (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These providers process data under their own privacy policies and/or as processors on our behalf, depending on the service.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local app content:</strong> stored on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Account/subscription metadata:</strong> retained as long as needed to provide the service and for legitimate business purposes (e.g., support, fraud prevention), unless a longer retention is required by law.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> retained for a limited period according to the tooling configuration and business needs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage
    is 100% secure, but we aim to protect your data with industry-standard practices.
  </p>

  <h2>8) Your choices and rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, and objection/withdrawal of consent.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local content:</strong> you can delete your data inside the App (where applicable) or uninstall the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign-in:</strong> you can revoke Apple/Google sign-in permissions in your Apple ID / Google account settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Requests:</strong> email us at <a href="mailto:info.pockex@gmail.com">info.pockex@gmail.com</a> and we’ll respond within a reasonable time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Data deletion requests</h2>
  <p>
    If you want us to delete any server-side identifiers or subscription-related records associated with your use of Pockex (to the extent we have them),
    contact <a href="mailto:info.pockex@gmail.com">info.pockex@gmail.com</a> from the email you used for sign-in (or include your Apple private relay email if applicable).
    For local data stored on your device, deleting it in the App (if available) or uninstalling the App will remove it from the device.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under the minimum age required by the laws of your jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal information
    from children without appropriate consent.
  </p>

  <h2>11) International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    If you access the App from outside the Republic of Korea, your information may be processed in countries where our service providers operate.
    We take steps designed to ensure appropriate safeguards where required.
  </p>

  <h2>12) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” above indicates when the latest version takes effect.
    If changes are material, we may provide additional notice within the App or on our website.
  </p>
