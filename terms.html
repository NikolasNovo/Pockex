    <strong>monthly</strong> or <strong>yearly</strong> auto-renewing subscriptions. The exact price and currency are displayed in the purchase flow
    before you confirm payment.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Auto-renewal, billing, and cancellation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Auto-renewal:</strong> subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period (store policy may vary by region).
    </li>

  <h2>7) Free trials and promotional offers (if offered)</h2>
  <p>
    If a free trial or promotional offer is available, the terms (duration, price after trial, eligibility) will be shown in the store purchase flow.

  </p>

  <h2>8) Restore purchases</h2>
  <p>
    If you reinstall the App or change devices, you can use the App’s “Restore Purchases” feature (if available) to restore your subscription,
    provided you use the same Apple ID / Google account used to purchase.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Refunds</h2>

    If you believe a charge was made in error, please use the store’s refund request process.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Local data storage</h2>
  <p>
    Most content you create in the App is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for backing up your device if you want to preserve local data.

  </p>

  <h2>11) Third-party services</h2>

    Your use of those services may be subject to their respective terms and policies.
  </p>

  <h2>12) Disclaimers</h2>

    or any loss of data, profits, or revenues, arising out of your use of the App.
  </p>

  <h2>14) Termination</h2>
  <p>
    You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access to the App if you materially breach these Terms or if required by law.
    Termination does not automatically cancel your store subscription. You must cancel your subscription through Apple/Google if you wish to stop future billing.
  </p>

  <h2>15) Changes to the App or Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update the App or these Terms from time to time. The “Effective date” indicates when the latest version applies.
    Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
  </p>

    If you use the App on Apple platforms, Apple’s Standard End User License Agreement may also apply:
